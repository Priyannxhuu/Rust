// Data types are type of values stored in variables

// Implict
// Unlike other languages like C++ and Java, Rust can infer the type from the type of value assigned to a variable.
// Syntax :
let varname = value;

// Explict
// Explict tells the compiler abput the type of variable
// Syntax : 
let varname : datatype = value;

// Primitive Data Types
/* Rust has a couple of types that are considered primitive.
That means they are built-in to the language.
There are different data types used for different purposes.*/

/* Primitive Have 2 Types
1. Scalar => 
(a) Numeric (i) Integer (ii) Float
(b) Non-Numeric (i) Boolean (ii) Character
2. Compound => (a) Array (b) Tuple
