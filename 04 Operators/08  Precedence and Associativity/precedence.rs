// Precedence
/* The precedence of an operator determines which operation is
performed first in an expression with more than one operators.*/

/*
Operators are listed below in the order of their precedence from highest to lowest :

Unary
Logical/Bitwise NOT - !
Derereference - *
Borrow - &, &mut
Binary
Typecast - as
Multiplication- *,Division - /, Remainder - %
Addition -+, Subtraction - -
Left Shift - <<, Right Shift - >>
Bitwise AND - &
Bitwise XOR - ^
Bitwise OR - |
Comparison - == != < > <= >=
Logical AND - &&
Logical OR - ||
Range - start .. stop
Assignment/Compound Assignment - = += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=
Note: The operators that are written in the same row have the same order of precedence.

Note: The range operator will be further explored while we discuss the for loop in the Loops chapter.
